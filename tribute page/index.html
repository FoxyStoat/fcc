	  <p class="text-justify">Ibrahim was ten years old when he lost both of his arms in a train accident, however, this did not stop him from following his dream of playing Table Tennis.  It was his favourite sport as a child and three years after his accident he wanted to play the game again, and so he gave it a try.  At first he tryed to hold the bat under his arm but this did not really work, after various other opptions he found that holding the bat in his mouth worked rather well.  He now uses the technique of holding the bat in his mouth while gripping with his teeth and he serves the ball by using his foot.</p> <br>
	  <p class="text-justify">Ibrahim was invited to the <a href="http://www.ittf.com/competitions/competitions2.asp?Competition_ID=2278" target="_blank">ZEN-NOH 2014</a> world team Table Tennis Championships in Tokyo as an honored guest, there he astounded some of the best Table Tennis players in the world with his accuracy and power.  Inbetween winning several honors over the years, including silver medals in the African Para Table Tennis Championships in 2011 and 2013 Ibrahim has also won an appreiciation award under the 6th Edition of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Mahtoum Creative Sports Award for the category of athlete who achieved success in sports despite major humanitarain challenges.</p>
	  <p class="text-justify">Ibrahim Hamato is a remarkable man, his story can teach us to never give up.  There are no limits to what we can do unless we place them on ourselves, so whatever we want to do in life we should give it our all and be grateful for the opportunities we have.  Ibrahim could have given up so easily but he didn't, he continued to follow and succeed at his dream without letting his circumstances dictate his life.</p>
